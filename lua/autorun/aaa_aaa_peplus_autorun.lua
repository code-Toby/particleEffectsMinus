//Blacklist bad effects from being loaded, and add info text for unintuitive ones; this was a lot more extensive in development, but 
//shrunk down considerably as we figured out how to handle conflicting fx better and auto-detect more things that need info text.

//The actual .pcf loading is done inside of ent_peplus.lua, because entity code always runs after autorun code -
//we want to be sure every addon that wants to add its own blacklist has the chance to do so before the .pcf files actually get read.


//Currently, the PEPlus_Pre/PostProcessPCF hooks are game path agnostic (there's no good way to get this for non-data pcfs, because
//they all get processed *before* being associated with a game path) - when we use data pcfs to load multiple versions of the same 
//pcf file from different games, the hooks only receive the same original pcf file path for each one, not the internal data pcf file 
//paths, because the latter is inconsistent depending on which games were mounted this session. 

//This does have the downside of not being able to distinguish between different games' versions of the same .pcf - for example, if 
//we were to run into a situation where one particular game's fire_01.pcf has a bad effect we want to blacklist, but other games' 
//fire_01.pcf have fx with the same name that we *don't* want to blacklist, then the hook wouldn't be able to tell them apart easily.

//However, it also has the upside of not caring where the pcf came from in all other cases too - for example, if a player loads a 
//game's pcf from an addon instead of mounting the game itself, then the hook won't care and will run all the same.
